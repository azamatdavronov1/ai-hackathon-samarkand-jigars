In many low-resource and rural areas, access to trained radiologists is limited or nonexistent. According to the WHO, over two-thirds of the global population lacks access to diagnostic imaging services, leading to millions of undiagnosed or misdiagnosed cases of tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia each year. Even where doctors are present, they may not have the specialized expertise to interpret complex chest X-rays accurately—especially under pressure or heavy patient loads. Studies show that misdiagnosis rates for TB can be as high as 25% in non-specialist settings, potentially delaying life-saving treatment.
MedScan AI is an AI-powered diagnostic assistant designed to support doctors by analyzing chest X-ray images to detect early signs of pneumonia and other lung opacity diseases. Our prototype currently uses MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network fine-tuned on a binary classification task (Pneumonia vs Normal), trained using public datasets. The model processes and classifies real-time single image uploads, generating confidence scores to assist in clinical decisions.
Although Grad-CAM visualization and multi-disease support (e.g., TB) are planned for future versions, this version focuses on a streamlined pipeline that mimics a doctor-AI collaboration: the AI gives a second opinion, but final judgment is left to the human expert.
Our system is designed for maximum accessibility: it's multilingual (English and Uzbek), mobile-friendly, and supports Uzbek voice feedback. The system’s modular architecture allows easy future expansion into other diagnostic areas like lung cancer or skin conditions using smartphone images.
With AI as a second opinion, even general practitioners in remote clinics can achieve more accurate and timely diagnoses. MedScan AI aims to reduce diagnostic errors and ultimately save lives. By bridging the gap between expertise and access, we bring the future of healthcare to the people who need it most.
